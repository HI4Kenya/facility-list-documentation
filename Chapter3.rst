System Analysis and Design

3.1 Methodology
------------------
Agile Methodology
The agile methodology of development will be used in this project. This practice promotes continuous 
iteration of development and testing throughout the software development lifecycle of the project. 
It intentionally allows for repeating software development activities, and for potentially revisiting
the same work products. Both the development and testing activities are concurrent. 
Nearly all Agile projects favor an incremental development strategy; meaning that each successive 
version of the product is usable, and each builds upon the previous version by adding user-visible 
functionality. It further involves collaborative customer engagement and quick response to changes 
in the project.
 
 Justification of agile methodology
i.The breaking down of the project into manageable units focuses on the high-quality development of products, testing and collaboration. 

ii.Producing frequent builds and conducting testing and reviews during each iteration, improves product quality by finding and fixing defects quickly and identifying expectation mismatches early.

iii.People and interactions are emphasized rather than process and tools. Customers, developers, and testers constantly interact with each other. 

iv.It focuses on users by using user stories with business-focused acceptance criteria to define product features. This means each feature incrementally delivers value, not just an IT component.
   
v.Regular adaptation to changing circumstances is quite easy as well as catering for late changes in requirements.

3.1 System Analysis
-------------------------
System analysis involves the process of collecting and interpreting the relevant facts on the project, 
identifying problems and decomposition of the system into its components. The purpose of system analysis was 
to study the system and its modules to clearly get its objectives and ensure that all the components of
the system work efficiently to accomplish the set-out requirements and goals.

3.2 User Requirements
-----------------------
These are the different user roles which can be performed by the user of DHIS2.THey are;
1.Log in to DHIS2 

2.Search for Afya 360 app

3.Search for facilities.

3.3 Functional Requirements
-------------------------------
These are the description of the features required and must be implemented by the system. It deals with what 
the system should do and or provide for its users.They are;
1.it should be intusive 
2.it should be able to fetch organisation unit in DHIS2 and facilities in KMFL
3.ability to search a facilities with its code,location,name.
4.The system should enable the user to update facility or drop details in the DHIS2 using the official 
accepted registry KMFL

3.4 Non Functional Requirements
---------------------------------
These are usually descriptions and, where possible target values of associated non-functional requirements. 
They may detail constraints, targets or control mechanisms for the system. The following were identified as 
the non-functional requirements for the system.
 1.The system should be efficiently and effectively built for the required platforms to ensure they 
   have good user experience and high usability.

 2.The system should be available,scalable,secure and realiable all the time to ensure interested users can use the platform at their time of need.
 
3.5 System User 
------------------------------
The users of the system will interact with the system through the DHIS2.The users of the system will be 
able to search facilities using the facility name,code and location.Also the system will allow users to 
resolve facility conflict that its in KMFL and DHIS2.The user will only update DHIS2 details.
