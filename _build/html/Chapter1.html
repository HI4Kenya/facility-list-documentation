<p>DHIS2 is a tool for collection, validation, analysis, and presentation of aggregate and
patient-based statistical data, tailored (but not limited) to integrated health information
management activities.One of its feature is through use of the DHIS2 Web-API
it allow for integration with external software and extension of the core platform
through the use of custom apps.AFYA 360 will be one of the custom application in the DHIS2
that will allow user to search for facilities inside DHIS2.Furthermore,the user will be able
to compare Organization Units(DHIS2) and facilities(KHMFL).</p>

<h2>1.0 Background<a class="headerlink" href="#background" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Over the years, use of  applications to solve problems had gained a lot of support and popularity all
over the world.Health sector has not been left behind in employing applications to solve problems.
With the development of DHIS2 in 1998-1999 ,the Ministry of Health is a able to aggregate data and
those Data needs to be made useful thought development of applications.Besides DHIS2 the
Ministry of Health has Kenya Master Health Facility List (KMHFL), is an application with all
health facilities and community units in Kenya. Each health facility and community unit is identified
with unique code and their details describing the geographical location, administrative location,
ownership, type and the services offered.
Afya 360 is an application that will integrate this two systems.it will enable DHIS2 users to to see
conflicts between facilities in DHIS2 and KMFL.</p>

<h2>1.1 Problem statement<a class="headerlink" href="#problem-statement" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Kenya Master Health Facility List (KMHFL) is an application with all health facilities and community
units in Kenya. Each health facility and community unit is identified with unique code and their
details describing the geographical location, administrative location, ownership, type and the
services offered.KMHFL is the official Registry of all the facilities in the country.For its the official
registry their was need to integrate it to DHIS2 beacause there are facilities that exists in DHIS2
and are not recognised and licensed by the Ministry of Health.Besisdes that it will enable DHIS2 users
search for facilities in DHIS2 and also able to compare facilities in both systems and resolve confict
in both systems.</p>
<p>MHL is a system that exists as a Facility Registry system. It has the official list of facilities
registered as health service institutions. Being able to integrate it in DHIS2 will help DHIS2 users
know if their facility or facilities they are in charge of are registered in this system.
Those who have their facilities registered may have different information in the systems and therefore
a need to compare the data in the two systems arises.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="research-objective">
<h2>1.2 Research Objective<a class="headerlink" href="#research-objective" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To investigate the effects of Dhis2 user adding facilities in Dhis2.</p>
<p>To find out if facilities in KMFL and DHIS2 match(name,code,services they offer and type)</p>
<p>To investigate why health HROs add new facilities in DHIS2</p>
<p>To find out if they is an existing facility registry in DHIS2 their features and how
they operate and to improve them to increase its acceptability and usability.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="system-objective">
<h2>1.3 System-Objective<a class="headerlink" href="#system-objective" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Create a facility registry application to be deployed and used  in DHIS2.
The application should be able to search through facility information available in KMHFL inside DHIS2.
A further ability is that it should be able to show conflicts in information about the two facilities
and give an option for resolving.A report is derived and it can be used to resolve the issue in DHIS2.
Our application focused o the name and code of the facilities.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="justification">
<h2>1.4 Justification<a class="headerlink" href="#justification" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Present systems are not intuitive and do not present a live search that allows a user who is not be
sure about the name of a facility and its location in terms of county, sub-county to the ward.
Afya 360 will provide a smart search for the user who has a little  knowledge about the facility they
want to search.Afya 360 will enable the users to know the  conflicts present in the two systems.
a further functionality of the app will be to allow for rectification by a relevant authority.</p>
