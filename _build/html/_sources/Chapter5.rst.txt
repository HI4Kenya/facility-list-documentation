5.3 challenges
----------------------
In spite of the successful completion of the project, there were challenges and hurdles encountered in its implementation. These included;

1.During every panel presentation,the panel kept changing our system requirements.

2.Half of the group members were new to programing so they had to learn first.Also most of the members were new to 
working with api and reactjs.

5.4 Conclusion
-------------------------
In conclusion, all the objectives set out at the begging of the project were met and successfully implemented.
The developed system is fast, responsive and highly automated. The system underwent vigorous testing and 
ensured that it meets its usability compatibility and user requirements.
With the completion of the project and with guidance by the supervisor, we gained a wealth of experience 
in software development, especially in react.js,material ui,react route.we learned how to objectively 
approach problems, perform evaluations and choose the best techniques and algorithms for implementation 
while keeping in mind the simplicity, usability and performance of the system/application.also how to work
as a team and techniques of pitching a project.
