Methodology
==============
Agile Methodology
The agile methodology of development will be used in this project. This practice promotes continuous 
iteration of development and testing throughout the software development lifecycle of the project. 
It intentionally allows for repeating software development activities, and for potentially revisiting
the same work products. Both the development and testing activities are concurrent. 
Nearly all Agile projects favor an incremental development strategy; meaning that each successive 
version of the product is usable, and each builds upon the previous version by adding user-visible 
functionality. It further involves collaborative customer engagement and quick response to changes 
in the project.
 
 Justification of agile methodology
i.The breaking down of the project into manageable units focuses on the high-quality development of products, testing and collaboration. 

ii.Producing frequent builds and conducting testing and reviews during each iteration, improves product quality by finding and fixing defects quickly and identifying expectation mismatches early.

iii.People and interactions are emphasized rather than process and tools. Customers, developers, and testers constantly interact with each other. 

iv.It focuses on users by using user stories with business-focused acceptance criteria to define product features. This means each feature incrementally delivers value, not just an IT component.
   
v.Regular adaptation to changing circumstances is quite easy as well as catering for late changes in requirements.
