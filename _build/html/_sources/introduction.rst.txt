INTRODUCTION
============
Background
===========

The metadata changelog and monitoring app is intended to provide certain information on DHIS2
activities to only permitted users by tracking the edits performed on the metadata so as to know
the type of changes made to avoid adverse effects and hold the users accountable. This helps by
by creating a sense of responsibility and for members of the MOH to make informed decisions based on the data collected and curated.

Problem Statement
=================
Ideal:  An application that would be able to keep track of all the metadata changes
Reality: The DHIS2 system only keeps track of the changes last edited, and provides a simple text report of the usage analytics. 
Consequences: It is not possible to hold users accountable for any changes in the DHIS2 system that might be of adverse effect to other data.
Proposal: Have an application that will be able to keep track of the major metadata changes, and visually represent how the DHIS2 system is put to use.
