Tracking the metadata.
=====================
After clicking the metadata audit app in the apps menu,It will direct you to its landing page that will display the categories of the metadata that one wants to track.

For instance one chooses the data element option,the page will show;
 -The data elements,the last time they were edited and a view history button for each.
So to track the changes to a particular data element,select view history;

This will display :
The timeline for that individual element.

From the time it was created, to the recent changes made and the deleted metadata.

It will also show the user who made the changes and the data contained in that metadata.
